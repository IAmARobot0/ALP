### Example Code 1

fName = "Mr"
lName = "Colley"

print(fName)

# Identify a variable in the code
# Answer: fName and lName are the variables

# Identify a string in the code
# Answer: "Mr" and "Colley" are strings

# Line 4 is changed to lName = "Thorpe".  How does this affect the output?
#Answer: it will not affect the output since the output is only printing out fName and lName will not be printed

# Line 3 is changed to fName = "Mrs". How does this affect the output?
# Answer: it will print out "Mrs" instead of "Mr"

### Example Code 2

num1 = 20
num2 = 5

total1 = num1 + 15  # 35=20+15
total2 = num2 * 2  # 10=5*2
total3 = num1 - num2  # 15=20-5

print(total3)

# What will be output by the program?
# Answer: 15

### Example Code 3

name1 = "Ross"
name2 = "Monica"
name3 = "Joey"
name4 = "Rachel"
name5 = "Chandler"

print(name1, " and ", name4)
print(name3)

name3 = "Phoebe"

# How many variables are used in the program?
# Answer: 6 are listed but only 3 are used

# What would be the impact of changing  print(name1, " and ", name4) to print(name1, " and ", name5) ?
# Answer: it will print "Ross  and  Chandler" instead of "Ross  and  Rachel" (with 2 spaces between the words)

# What is the purpose of the '+' symbol in  print(name1, " and ", name4)
# Answer: it joins the strings together so the print statement can print all 3 strings

# The line  print(name3) is added to the end of the code.  Explain what it will do.
# Answer: it will print "Phoebe" on the fifth line
