# Add comments to this code to predict what it will do.
print(8 + 2) # prints 10

print( 8 - 2) # prints 6

print(8 * 2) # prints 16

print(10 / 4) # prints 2.5

print(10 // 4) # prints 2, // divides then floors to an integer

# This code uses variables in place of numbers in the calculation.  Add comments to explain how it works.

num1 = 20 # assigns num1 to 20
num2 = 5 # assigns num 2 to 5

result = num1 * num2 # assigsns result to the product of num1 (20) and num2 (5) so result=20*5=100

print(result) # prints 100

# This code uses input to assign data into a variable.  Add comments to explain how it works.
print("Enter a number") # prints a prompt for the user
num1 = int(input()) # makes the input into an integer and assigns it to num1
num2 = 2 # assigns num2 to 2

result = num1 // num2 # assigns result to the end result of dividing num1 (the user's input) by num2 and flooring the answer to an integer

print(result) # prints the result of the calculation above
