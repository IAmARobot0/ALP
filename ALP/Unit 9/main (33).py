# Example Code


def maths1():
  num1 = 50
  num2 = 5
  return num1 + num2


def maths2():
  num1 = 50
  num2 = 5
  return num1 - num2


def maths3(num1, num2):
  return num1 * num2


outputNum = maths2()
print(outputNum)

# How many functions are there in the code?
# Answer: 3 functions

# How do you know that they are functions, not just subroutines?
# Answer: for example the print function outputs string to the console but the subrountines return something or have multiple functions inside them

# Which functions have parameters?  How can you tell?
# Answer: maths3 function has parameters because there are variables in it's parentheses

# Which functions are called in the code?
# Answer: maths2()

# How do you know which lines of code belong to a function or subroutine?
# Answer: indentation show where the line is and subrountines have def to start them while functions are usually more simple
